On the left is a population of 1 million simulated over about 5 years with a defense rate of 80% at random in the population. The right is the same simulation but with a defense rate of only 60%. The contagion itself is modeled after SARS-COV-2. Low defense rates lead to potential endemics. ([Full video](https://vimeo.com/514490979))

### Corona vs Ebola

An identical simulation comparing a Coronavirus variant to Ebola. The structure in the middle is made out of two layers of dead cells, this structure does appear to be helpful in containing Ebola but not Corona. Two layer walls are needed because [Corona can move through walls.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-senior-citizens-wall-defence-1.5832611) ([Full video](https://vimeo.com/514514010))

Cellular Defense Automata is a simulation similar to other discrete models of computation like [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) ðŸ’€[[R.I.P.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/technology/john-horton-conway-dead-coronavirus.html)]ðŸ’€. 

For modeling contagion dissemination in networks, CDA models memes like viruses. As a result, it is a good model for how critical source control defenses can actually be [(such as with face masks and virus  spread)](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent) but also in other network and complex scenarios such as communication networks.

## How It Works

Cellular Defense Automata are represented on each cell of the neighbourhood. These cells can represent individual cells in an organism, people in a social network, or a network of cities, countries, or even [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia). They can give and receive self replicating units called memes.

**Computer Viruses: a Model for an Informational Epidemiology** 

Computer viruses are pieces of code that graft themselves into existing programs and subvert their actions. They are technically distinguished from ''worms'' which are whole programs in their own right, usually traveling over networks. Both viruses and worms are programs that actually say, in computer language, ''Duplicate me''. Virus side-effects may be humorous (like the virus that makes the Macintosh's built-in loudspeaker enunciate the words ''Don't panic,'' with predictably opposite effect) or malicious.

The appeal of the virus to a certain kind of puerile mentality means that publication of information on designing virus programs is rightly seen as an irresponsible act. A computer fanciers' magazine that printed the text of a virus program for the interest of its readers has been widely condemned.

A virus that clones itself too prolifically within one computer will soon be detected because the symptoms of clogging will become too obvious to ignore. For this reason many virus programs check, before infecting a system, to make sure that they are not already on that system. Incidentally, this opens the way for a defense against viruses that is analogous to immunization.

A virus that is too virulent will be rapidly detected and scotched. A virus that instantly and catastrophically sabotages every computer in which it finds itself will not find itself in many computers. It may have a most amusing effect on one computer ---- erase an entire doctoral thesis or something equally side-splitting --- but it won't spread as an epidemic.

Some viruses, therefore, are designed to have an effect that is small enough to be difficult to detect, but which may nevertheless be extremely damaging. 

Cruise ships, airplanes, trains, buses, gyms, [places of worship](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/alta-pastor-charged-with-violating-public-health-act-still-in-custody-for-refusing-conditions-rcmp-1.5313426), or nearly any enclosed environment can be modelled in a similar way as a social network can be. You might not think you are connected to everyone you share aire with.


## Contagions

A contagion operates on top of a substrate such as computer netowrk or living organism. Therefore the dynamics of the spread of viruses in biological networks as well information networks can be modeled similarly.


We are not only in a pandemic with biological viruses, but also with misinformation that correlates with threat responses of a society and culture.

Misinformation is a very natural phenomena, just like viruses, even children who play [Chinese whispers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers) understand that information can become corrupted as it passes through a network even if most agents act in good faith! That said, memes can also be weaponized just like a virus can be, and do a lot of "real world" harm or good.
