Tired of waiting for your herds to reach immunity? Now you can simulate [serial passaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_passage) ðŸ§«ðŸ§«ðŸ§«ðŸ§« in your web browser instead of actually serial passaging it! MemeLab is a Javascript contagion simulator for your web browser. Use it to see the effect of masks and vaccines against [memetic pathogens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics)

## Model

### Cell Dynamics

The  [SEIR model is a standard compartmental model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) in which the population is divided into **susceptible (S)**, **exposed (E)**, **infectious (I)**, and **recovered (R)** individuals. 

A susceptible member of the population becomes infected (exposed) when making a transmissive contact with an infectious individual and then progresses to the infectious, then the recovery state (zombie), and finally RIP.

#### Defenses

All defenses have the same types of variables and can influence the odds of transmission occuring after the attack rate is calculated, such as the level of protection of a mask. Masks and vaccines can be combined together as they provide different types of benefits for the cells.

## Natural Selection

If the Natural Selection button is enabled, the memes mutate their phenotypes and will be allowed to the oppurtunity to evolve each transmission event.
